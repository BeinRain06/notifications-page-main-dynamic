## My process

Kind of harsh my Process.

have first implement the whole page in html/css and then rezrite it to suit with ReactJs
here are the features used:

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

The overall features seems tiny, but can be very interesting.
Walk through Live site Url Above and you might see.

### What I learned

I learn a lot in this project because i was implementing it in React.
It mwde me revies my knowledges on css alignments box, perform basic rendering zith reactjs, and play with little animations and hover. Hope you will enjoy the looks like...

### Continued development

I like to ;qke this first page dynamic. The idea is to render notication randomly each time on the button `update` save every page in local Storage, and goes back the the previous page showns in the DOM zhen hitting the `reload` webpage button. I think it can enlight the notification-page much bigger.
