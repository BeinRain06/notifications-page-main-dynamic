## My process

Kind of harsh my Process.

have first implement the whole page in html/css and then rezrite it to suit with ReactJs
here are the features used:

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

The overall features seems tiny, but can be very interesting.
Walk through Live site Url Above and you might see.

### What I learned

This part is a section aside where we allowed us to implement some update based to the re-rendering in DoM of React.

Hope, this enhance some dynamic effects. I have tried to bring up kind some change, though i felt to animate my design.

I will find a way to make it more attractive with future design.

have a good looks

### Continued development

I like to work in other sortable projects lists to see how it will be fun when being done to make list items draggable playing around with these onem and see if it bring also at our eyes goods results . The idea we zill have to try.
